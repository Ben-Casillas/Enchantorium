This application is a site to buy, sell and bid mythical creature companions, these companions are ready to help their new friends out with any tasks they may need.
Users can also buy and sell what we like to call, "Cosmic Manifistation Trinkets", no matter what users do with these trinkets, we hold no legal responsibility. 

# How to use
Simply register either a buyer or seller account, buyers can view Companions or Trickets sold by different sellers, if there is a bid, the user can bid for more than the currect highest.
If there is no bid, than the buyer can outright buy the Companion or Trinket. Once purchased, the buyers shipping details will be promopted. Enchantorium holds no legal responsibility for
